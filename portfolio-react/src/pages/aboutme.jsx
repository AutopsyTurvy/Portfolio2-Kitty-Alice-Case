          Hello there! 
          <br />
          My name is Kitty (or Alice, if you like!) - I am a Front-End Development student at Noroff school in Norway!
          <br />
          Coding was a life-changing decision after many years spent as an artist, and I find the creative potential so exciting!
          The journey from paper to pixels was a huge jump for me, especially as someone who is habitually described as
          "Victorian" by friends and teachers, but now I stand before youâ€”a thoroughly chaotic, but passionate Front-End
          Development Student!
          <br />
          March marks the end of our Journet with Noroff school, and what a journey is has been! 
          We've gone into Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, CSS Modules and a wonderful variety of frameworks- Usually we had the choice so that 
          we could form a preference, and I fall happily on the side of CSS Modules, but with all of the options, 
          that may easily change depending on the project.
          
          <br />

          Where my journey leads now, who can say? I will be looking into freelance coding opportunities for further experience,
          and expanding on my own style!
          I aim to further refine my skills and contribute to projects that make the digital world a more inclusive, beautiful, and engaging place.
